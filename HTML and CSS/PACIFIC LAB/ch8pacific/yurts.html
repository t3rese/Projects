        <h2> The Yurts at Pacific Trails </h2>

        <section>
            <h3> <strong>What is a yurt?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
                walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </p>

            <h3> <strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping includes
                electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <h3> <strong> What should I bring?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
                It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
